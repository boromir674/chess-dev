  + Development is somewhat equal. White has a space advantage due to his pawns on d4 and e5. Theree some tension between the c4 and d5 pawns. Black has solved his typical "bad" bishop problem by having developed his light-squared bishop on g6 using two tempos.
    White claims that black's light-squared bishop is somewhat aiming at nothing. White achieves to occupy a nice outpost for his dark-squared bishop on g5
